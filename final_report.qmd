## Group Replication Portion

### Graph Replication

This is the original graph that we intend to replicate:

![](images/Replicate%20Graph.png){width="372"}

The paper sourced its data from Global Burden of Disease 2019 database (Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)). After searching through the IHME schema, we obtained our data from this [link](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihmde-data/gbd-2019-life-expectancy-HALE-1990-2019) and downloaded the data with appropriate fields from this [link](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/). With that done, we first read our data:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data/life_expectancy.csv")
```

First, filter for the years 2002 and 2019, and obtain the location_name, year, and life expectancy value (val).

```{r}
# 2019 life expectancy
LE_2019 <- data %>%
  select(location_name, val, year) %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>%
  arrange(val)

# 2002 life expectancy
LE_2002 <- data %>%
  select(location_name, val, year) %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  arrange(val)
```

Next, we had to combine the data from the 2002 and 2019 years, and order it by countries in 2002 from lowest to highest life expectancy.

```{r}
# Combines the data and orders by 2002 LE
combined <- sqldf("SELECT a.location_name as Country,a.val as Life_Expectancy_2002,
                    b.val as Life_Expectancy_2019
                FROM LE_2002 as a
                JOIN LE_2019 as b
                WHERE a.location_name = b.location_name
                ORDER BY a.val ASC;
                ")

# Locks the countries so that ggplot can't auto arrange it
combined$Country <- factor(combined$Country, levels = combined$Country)

# Splits LE in 2002 and 2019 into two rows instead of columns
combined_long <- combined %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Life_Expectancy"), 
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "Life_Expectancy") %>%
  mutate(Year = gsub("Life_Expectancy_", "", Year))
```

Finally, visualize the data on ggplot2.

```{r}
# Plots the LE sorted by 2002 LE
combined_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = Life_Expectancy, group = Year, color = Year)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("2002" = "red", "2019" = "blue")) +
  labs(color = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy",
       x = "Countries sorted by 2002 Life Expectancy",
       title = "Life Expectancy of Countries in 2002 and 2019")
```

### Table Replication

The table that we intend to replicate is:

![](images/Replicate%20Table.png){width="600"}

Due to the authors performing complex math equations, from this [data source](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2013-hiv-tuberculosis-and-malaria-incidence-prevalence-and-mortality-1990-2013), we chose to write the numerical data by hand instead of performing the same calculations. The following code is our attempt at replicating the table:

```{r}
# This creates the matrix for the table, each represents a column in the table
dis_tab <- data.frame(
  "Column_1"= c("Low-income countries","India","Lower-middle-income countries","China","Upper-middle class-income countries","High-income countries","Global"),
  "Total" = c(7.66, 6.96, 4.56, 5.59, 2.26, 2.61, 5.48),
  "HIV, malaria, and TB" = c(2.56, 0.93, 0.44, 0.10, 0.15, 0.05, 0.86),
  "HIV" = c(1.40, 0.22, 0.28, -0.02, 0.10, 0.04, 0.42),
  "Malaria" = c(0.50, 0.12, 0.01, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.14),
  "TB" = c(0.66, 0.59, 0.15, 0.12, 0.05, 0.02, 0.31),
  "HIV, malaria and TB Share of Total Gain Percent" = c(33.4, 13.4, 9.6, 1.8, 6.9, 2.1, 15.8), 
  "Population Share Percent" = c(22.9, 17.1, 18.3, 21.1, 5.3, 15.4, 100.0)
)

# Created two separate tables, combining proved to be complex
dis_tab2 <- data.frame(
  "Column_1_1" = c("Low-income countries (excl. India)", "Low-income countries (incl. India)"),
  "Total" = c(32.0, 53.8),
  "HIV, malaria, and TB" = c(67.9, 86.4),
  "HIV" = c(76.9, 86.0),
  "Malaria" = c(84.0, 99.1),
  "TB" = c(48.8, 81.4)
)

# This removes the unwanted periods from the column titles
names(dis_tab) <- gsub("\\.", " ", names(dis_tab))
names(dis_tab2) <- gsub("\\.", " ", names(dis_tab2))

# Create the formatted table using gt, and wanted to leave the first column empty like for reproducibility purposes
dis_table <- gt(dis_tab) %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Gain in life expectancy (years)"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    "Column_1" = ""
  ) %>%
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = "Source: Countries Grouped by Income (2002 World Bank classification)"
  )

dis_table2 <- gt(dis_tab2) %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Share of gains accruing in low-income countries and India (percent)"
  ) %>% 
  cols_label(
    "Column_1_1" = ""
  ) %>%
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = "Source: Countries Grouped by Income (2002 World Bank classification)"
)

# This prints the tables for viewing
dis_table
dis_table2
```

### Isaac

In this section, we will explore the question: **Has HIV, TB, and Malaria deaths decreased between the years 2002 and 2013 globally?**

-   **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: HIV, TB, and Malaria deaths globally have not decreased significantly over the years 2002 and 2013

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: HIV, TB, and Malaria prevalence & deaths globally have decreased significantly over the years 2002 and 2013

To do this, first load in the datasets

```{r}
HIV_TB <- read.csv("data/HIV_TB_INCIDENCE_PREVALENCE_DEATHS.csv")
Malaria <- read.csv("data/MALARIA_INCIDENCE_DEATHS.csv")
```

Using the countrycode package, retrieve every country's ISO3 code, e.g: Australia = AUS

```{r}
valid_iso3 <- unique(countrycode::codelist$iso3c)
```

Perform data cleaning, filtering out invalid ISO3 codes, retrieving only "deaths" from "both sexes" in "all ages" from year "2002" and greater.

```{r}
HIV_TB_filtered <- HIV_TB %>%
  filter(age_group_name == "All Ages") %>%
  filter(location_code %in% valid_iso3) %>%
  filter(metric == "Deaths") %>%
  filter(unit == "Number") %>%
  filter(sex_name == "Both sexes") %>%
  filter(year >= 2002)

Malaria_filtered <- Malaria %>%
  filter(age_group_name == "All Ages") %>%
  filter(location_code %in% valid_iso3) %>%
  filter(metric == "Deaths") %>%
  filter(unit == "Number") %>%
  filter(sex_name == "Both sexes") %>%
  filter(year >= 2002)
```

Pull HIV means for each country in years 2002 and 2013

```{r}
HIV_2002 <- HIV_TB_filtered %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  filter(cause_name == "HIV/AIDS") %>%
  pull(mean)

HIV_2002 <- as.numeric(HIV_2002)

HIV_2013 <- HIV_TB_filtered %>%
  filter(year == 2013) %>%
  filter(cause_name == "HIV/AIDS") %>%
  pull(mean)

HIV_2013 <- as.numeric(HIV_2013)
```

Similarly, pull TB and Malaria means for each country in years 2002 and 2013

```{r}
TB_2002 <- HIV_TB_filtered %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  filter(cause_name == "Tuberculosis") %>%
  pull(mean)

TB_2002 <- as.numeric(TB_2002)

TB_2013 <- HIV_TB_filtered %>%
  filter(cause_name == "Tuberculosis") %>%
  filter(year == 2013) %>%
  pull(mean)

TB_2013 <- as.numeric(TB_2013)
```

```{r}
Malaria_2002 <- Malaria_filtered %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  filter(cause_name == "Malaria") %>%
  pull(mean)

Malaria_2002 <- as.numeric(Malaria_2002)

Malaria_2013 <- Malaria_filtered %>%
  filter(cause_name == "Malaria") %>%
  filter(year == 2013) %>%
  pull(mean)

Malaria_2013 <- as.numeric(Malaria_2013)
```

Now, perform hypothesis testing for each disease. Starting with HIV:

```{r}
HIV_t_test <- t.test(
  x = HIV_2002,
  y = HIV_2013,
  alternative = "two.sided", 
  paired = TRUE,
  conf.level = 0.95
)
HIV_t_test
```

The t value is 0.752, and the p-value is 0.453. Since p \> 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, HIV deaths have not decreased significantly between the years 2002 and 2013 globally. Moving on to TB:

```{r}
TB_t_test <- t.test(
  x = TB_2002,
  y = TB_2013,
  alternative = "two.sided", 
  paired = TRUE,
  conf.level = 0.95
)
TB_t_test
```

The t value is 2.081, and the p-value is 0.0388. Since p \< 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate for TB deaths. Thus, TB deaths have decreased significantly between the years 2002 and 2013 globally. Finally for malaria:

```{r}
Malaria_t_test <- t.test(
  x = Malaria_2002,
  y = Malaria_2013,
  alternative = "two.sided", 
  paired = TRUE,
  conf.level = 0.95
)
Malaria_t_test
```

The t value is 4.464, and the p-value is 1.389e-05. Since p \< 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate for malaria deaths. Thus, malaria deaths have decreased significantly between the years 2002 and 2013 globally.

In conclusion, HIV deaths have not decreased significantly between the years 2002 and 2013. However, TB and malaria have both decreased significantly. This table and figure visualizes each disease's global death rates in 2002 and 2013:

```{r}
HIV_2002_sum <- sum(HIV_2002)
HIV_2013_sum <- sum(HIV_2013)
Malaria_2002_sum <- sum(Malaria_2002)
Malaria_2013_sum <- sum(Malaria_2013)
TB_2002_sum <- sum(TB_2002)
TB_2013_sum <- sum(TB_2013)

summary_data <- data.frame(
  condition = rep(c("HIV", "Malaria", "TB"), each = 2),
  year = rep(c(2002, 2013), times = 3),
  sum_value = c(HIV_2002_sum, HIV_2013_sum, Malaria_2002_sum, Malaria_2013_sum, TB_2002_sum, TB_2013_sum)
)

print(summary_data)
```

```{r}
ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = condition, y = sum_value, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("2002" = "cornflowerblue", "2013" = "darkslategray1")) +
  labs(
    title = "Sum of Deaths for HIV, Malaria, and TB (2002 vs. 2013)",
    x = "Disease",
    y = "Sum of Deaths",
    fill = "Year"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
